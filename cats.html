        <h2> Disadvantages of Cats</h2>
        <p>Cats shed alot. Their litter boxes require cleaning. They may claw your furniture to shreds. So keeping a cats' litter box in a place far away from the room you sleep, and keeping them indoors in a place away from furniture would be a good idea.</p>
