        <h2>Disadvantages of dogs</h2>
        <p>The biggest problem of dogs is that they poop everywhere -- From sofas to beds to public places to when you are walking with one. They chew stuff and accidently knock things over. They are very unhygenic. Keeping a dog outdoors would be better than indoors.</p>
